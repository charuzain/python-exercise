# Sorting Lists I
# Often, we will want to sort a list in either numerical (1, 2, 3, …) or alphabetical (a, b, c, …) order.

# We can sort a list using the method .sort().

# Suppose that we have a list of names:

# names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]
# Let’s see what happens when we apply .sort():

# names.sort()
# print(names)
# Would output:

# ['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']
# As we can see, the .sort() method sorted our list of names in alphabetical order.

# .sort() also provides us the option to go in reverse. Instead of sorting in ascending order like we just saw, we can do so in descending order.

# names.sort(reverse=True)
# print(names)
# Would output:

# ['Xander', 'Willow', 'Giles', 'Buffy', 'Angel']
# Note: The .sort() method does not return any value and thus does not need to be assigned to a variable since it modifies the list directly. If we do assign the result of the method, it would assign the value of None to the variable.

# Checkpoint 1 & 2
addresses = ["221 B Baker St.", "42 Wallaby Way", "12 Grimmauld Place", "742 Evergreen Terrace", "1600 Pennsylvania Ave", "10 Downing St."]
addresses.sort()
print(addresses)



# Checkpoint 3
names = ["Ron", "Hermione", "Harry", "Albus", "Sirius"]
names.sort()
print(names)


# # Checkpoint 4 & 5
cities = ["London", "Paris", "Rome", "Los Angeles", "New York"]
cities.sort(reverse = True)
print(cities)
