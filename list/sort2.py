# Sorting Lists II
# A second way of sorting a list in Python is to use the built-in function sorted().

# The sorted() function is different from the .sort() method in two ways:

# It comes before a list, instead of after as all built-in functions do.
# It generates a new list rather than modifying the one that already exists.
# Letâ€™s return to our list of names:

# names = ["Xander", "Buffy", "Angel", "Willow", "Giles"]
# Using sorted(), we can create a new list, called sorted_names:

# sorted_names = sorted(names)
# print(sorted_names)
# This yields the list sorted alphabetically:

# ['Angel', 'Buffy', 'Giles', 'Willow', 'Xander']
# Note that using sorted did not change names:

# print(names)
# Would output:

# ['Xander', 'Buffy', 'Angel', 'Willow', 'Giles']
# Instructions
# 1.Use sorted() to order games and create a new list called games_sorted.
# 2.Print both games and games_sorted. How are they different?

games = ["Portal", "Minecraft", "Pacman", "Tetris", "The Sims", "Pokemon"]

# Your code below:
games_sorted = sorted(games)
print(games_sorted)
print(games)
